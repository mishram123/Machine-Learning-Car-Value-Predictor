# Machine-Learning-Car-Value-Predictor
This program utilizes machine learning to predict the selling price of a car based on user-provided inputs. It employs a linear regression model trained on a dataset containing information about various cars.

Dependencies
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Make sure to install these dependencies before running the program.

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Dataset: Ensure you have a CSV file named 'cardekho_data.csv' containing the required car data.

Run the program: Execute the script in a Python environment.

bash
Copy code
python car_price_prediction.py
Input Information: The program will prompt you to enter specific details about the car you want to predict the selling price for, including Car Name, Year, Kms Driven, and Transmission type.

Prediction: The program will use a pre-trained linear regression model to predict the selling price based on the entered information.

Visualization: A bar chart will be displayed comparing the actual average selling price for the entered car in the specified year with the predicted selling price.

Output: The predicted selling price will be printed to the console.

Example
bash
Copy code
Enter Car Name: City
Enter Year: 2017
Enter Kms Driven: 50000
Enter Transmission (Automatic or Manual): Manual
Note
The program assumes that the input values are valid and match the format of the training data.
Ensure the 'cardekho_data.csv' file is in the same directory as the script.
